Silverstripe Tax Admin
======================

Adds ability to create and edit tar rates and categories in
the CMS (via siteconfig).

This allows for flexible tax configuratuions (meaning that
you can have tax rates for different countries, zones, etc).

You can then map these categories (or rates) to products,
line items (in invoices) etc and use them in your tax
calculations.
